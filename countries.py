'''
Write a program that prompts the user to input a word and a filename. 
The program should print each line of the file that contains the word.

Here is an example run of the program:

    Enter a word: United
    Enter a filename: countries.csv
    United Arab Emirates,9890402,83600,118
    United Kingdom,67886011,241930,281
    United States of America,331002651,9147420,36

The user might incorrectly type the filename (Ex: countries.txt instead of countries.csv). 
Your program should output an error message if the file is not found, 
and keep prompting the user to input a filename until the file is found.
